         "Projective drawing tests such as the Draw-A-Person Test emerged in the early 20th century, first popularized by Florence Goodenough in the 1920s and expanded by Karen Machover in the 1940s. These tools were never intended to deliver firm diagnoses but rather to provide a window into unconscious attitudes, conflicts, and self-perceptions, using the act of drawing as a projection of inner life. Over the decades, psychologists have examined recurring themes—such as omitted body parts, distortions, or exaggerated features—as symbolic indicators of how individuals relate to power, aggression, vulnerability, and connection.\n\nIn this context, when a man with a history of sexual assault and belittling women depicts a woman’s torso without arms, the omission takes on sharper meaning. Arms in projective symbolism often represent agency, strength, and the ability to act or embrace. Removing them can unconsciously reduce the figure to passivity, objectification, and powerlessness. Such a drawing might reflect not only the man’s distorted perception of women as controllable or diminished, but also his internalized hostility and need to strip women of autonomy. The absence of arms is less a literal oversight and more a psychological statement—revealing entrenched attitudes of domination, disempowerment, and detachment from mutual human connection.",
